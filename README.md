# Angelin's Professional Portfolio

## Website Overview
    The web application named Angelin's Portfolio is my personal professional website to display my portfolio to future employers. The goal for this website is to showcase my work at a single place as I advance through the bootcamp and create additional websites.
    As of now, my website for HTML&CSS has been liked within the Angelin's Portfolio website.
    Key benefit for this webside is for me to present my skills I have learnt to potential employers that is viewable tin different screen sizes.
