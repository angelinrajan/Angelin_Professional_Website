                <p> Hello!  Thank you for your company's interest in viewing my portfolio. I have been working in the IT industry for over
                     6 years. My experience has been in software testing and curently work for Jacobs Technologies as a Test Engineer. I 
                     am looking to switch careers to Software Development due to my keen interest in coding. So far I have learnt HTML and 
                     CSS. Please refer to the <span data-descr="Html & CSS website now available for viewing">"My Work"</span> section to view some of my work. This section is in-progress. More websites 
                     will be added as I advance through the bootcamp.
                </p>
